# Midland Wheelers Cycle Club

This website is to provide a focal point for cycling activites for those people who live in and around around Athlone, Ireland.

Midland Wheelers will interest cyclists who enjoy social, keep-fit and leisure activities, in a friendly and welcoming environment. 

With the opening of a new Greenway along the disused Athlone - Mullingar rail line, there is a fantasic 40km cycle route on a paved surface with no vehicular traffic. As it become more used there will be an interest in having organised group cycles for the casual enthusiast.
