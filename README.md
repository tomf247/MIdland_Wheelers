# Midland Wheelers Cycle Club

The site provides a focal point for cycling activites for those people who live in and around Athlone, Ireland.

Midland Wheelers is of benefit to cyclists who enjoy social, keep-fit and leisure activities, in a friendly and welcoming environment. 

With the opening of a new Greenway along the disused Athlone - Mullingar rail line, there is a fantasic 40km cycle route on a paved surface with no vehicular traffic. As it gains popularity there is an interest in having organised group cycles for the casual enthusiast. This is where the Cycle Club website becomes useful.
